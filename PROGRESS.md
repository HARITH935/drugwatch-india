## Phase 0 — Setup

- [x] 1. Create monorepo structure (plan §19): `git init -b main`, `.gitignore`, top-level folders with `.gitkeep`
- [x] 2. Write `CLAUDE.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/adr/0001-stack-choice.md`
      (drafted 2026-11-03 ahead of Phase 0, then updated: labelled eval set rename, teaching mode)
- [x] 3. `docker-compose.yml` with PostgreSQL, RustFS, Redis, Mailpit — all four healthy and used end-to-end
      with throwaway credentials, then removed (`down -v`). Host ports 5433 and 6380 avoid OpsPilot.
- [x] 4. `.env.example` (no real secrets), including SMTP settings for Mailpit — blanks for secrets
      (compose refuses to start until filled); verified tracked by git, `.env` ignored.
- [x] 5. GitHub Actions lint workflow (Python + Java + TypeScript as each appears) — repo hygiene checks
      for now (`.github/scripts/repo-checks.sh`); first run green. Repo: https://github.com/HARITH935/drugwatch-india
- [x] 6. RustFS buckets: `raw`, `bronze`, `silver` — `docker compose run --rm rustfs-init` runs
      `infra/rustfs/create-buckets.sh` (curl SigV4, idempotent). Verified from a full `down -v` wipe.

**Done when:** `docker compose up` starts all four services; RustFS buckets exist; the Mailpit inbox is
reachable; CI passes.

Checklists for later phases are copied in from `DRUGWATCH_PHASES.md` §9 when each phase starts.
