## Phase 0 — Setup

- [x] 1. Create monorepo structure (plan §19): `git init -b main`, `.gitignore`, top-level folders with `.gitkeep`
- [x] 2. Write `CLAUDE.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/adr/0001-stack-choice.md`
      (drafted 2026-11-03 ahead of Phase 0, then updated: labelled eval set rename, teaching mode)
- [x] 3. `docker-compose.yml` with PostgreSQL, RustFS, Redis, Mailpit — all four healthy and used end-to-end
      with throwaway credentials, then removed (`down -v`). Host ports 5433 and 6380 avoid OpsPilot.
- [x] 4. `.env.example` (no real secrets), including SMTP settings for Mailpit — blanks for secrets
      (compose refuses to start until filled); verified tracked by git, `.env` ignored.
- [x] 5. GitHub Actions lint workflow (Python + Java + TypeScript as each appears) — repo hygiene checks
      for now (`.github/scripts/repo-checks.sh`); first run green. Repo: https://github.com/HARITH935/drugwatch-india
- [x] 6. RustFS buckets: `raw`, `bronze`, `silver` — `docker compose run --rm rustfs-init` runs
      `infra/rustfs/create-buckets.sh` (curl SigV4, idempotent). Verified from a full `down -v` wipe.

**Done when:** `docker compose up` starts all four services; RustFS buckets exist; the Mailpit inbox is
reachable; CI passes.

## Phase 1 — Source discovery

- [x] 1. Locate CDSCO central and state alert pages; record URL patterns → `docs/data-sources.md` §1.
      Found two sources: the legacy PDF list on `cdsco.gov.in` (stops Jun 2025, gaps, two-hop downloads)
      and the NSQ portal on `cdscoonline.gov.in` (JSON endpoints, Jan 2019 – Sep 2026).
      Decided: portal is primary from 2019, PDFs kept (ADR 0004).
- [x] 2. Locate NPPA and Jan Aushadhi lists → `docs/data-sources.md` §2–3.
      NPPA: PDFs (compendia 2016/2022, lists to 2020, 2026 orders feed) + a 2026 Compendium dashboard with a
      browser-only CSV export; Pharma Sahi Daam's data endpoints use request signing → off-limits.
      Jan Aushadhi: SPA; product list via a JSON API that needs an anonymous guest token (not used yet).
      Policy decided in step 3 (ADR 0003). ⚠️ Still open: no bulk source for branded prices (§4.6), revisit in Phase 3/4.
- [x] 3. Check `robots.txt` and terms for each source → `docs/data-sources.md` §4.
      No site restricts automated access; CDSCO and Jan Aushadhi require permission to republish (NPPA doesn't).
      Decided: ADR 0003 (anonymous-visitor access rule + permission-first republishing),
      ADR 0004 (CDSCO portal JSON primary from 2019, PDFs kept). Email drafts in `docs/permissions.md`.
      ⏳ Harith to send the two permission emails (not blocking: needed before Phase 12 launch).
- [ ] 4. Build a downloader: rate-limited, retries, skips files already in RustFS (hash check).
  - [x] 4a. Python tooling approved (ADR 0005: requests, boto3, uv, pytest, ruff). `ingestion/` uv project
        (src layout, `uv.lock`), repo-root `ruff.toml`, `python` CI job (ruff check, format check, pytest).
  - [x] 4b. Core: polite fetcher (≥3 s/host, retries with backoff, honest UA, timeouts) + RustFS store
        (hash check, metadata), with unit tests. `fetcher.py` (PoliteFetcher; stops on 403/429) +
        `store.py` (RawStore: content-addressed keys + `.meta.json` sidecar, never overwrites).
        27 unit tests (local scripted HTTP server, fake clock, fake S3) + 1 integration test passed on real
        RustFS (throwaway bucket). Layout documented in `docs/data-sources.md` §6.
  - [ ] 4c. Source adapters, one at a time:
    - [x] CDSCO portal JSON (`sources/cdsco_portal.py`): month list from the portal's menus, one month per
          request, shape check (fields, row count, month) before storing, skip if stored unless `--refresh`.
          16 tests (made-up rows only: real rows aren't committed, ADR 0003). Real run: NSQ Sep-2026 (330 rows)
          + spurious Sep-2026 (1 row) stored in `raw/`; spurious field list confirmed; 5 requests.
    - [x] CDSCO legacy PDF list (`sources/cdsco_pdf.py`): reads the alerts table (stdlib `html.parser`), keeps
          44 documents (21 central NSQ, 9 state, 10 spurious, 3 combined, 1 bulk 2017-2023; matches the step-1
          inventory), alert month parsed from free-text titles and checked against the release date, two-hop
          download, `%PDF-` check. 29 tests (real title variants, fake site). Real run: June 2025 central NSQ
          (file 12927, 6 pages, 188,795 bytes) stored with ETag / Last-Modified; 3 requests.
    - [ ] Jan Aushadhi product API (guest token)
    - [ ] NPPA PDFs + manual drop (ADR 0003)
- [ ] 5. Download the full historical archive into `raw/` with metadata (source, alert month, download time, file hash).
- [ ] 6. Document everything in `docs/data-sources.md`: URLs, formats, layout changes over time, scanned vs text PDFs.

**Done when:** every available historical file is in RustFS with metadata, and sources are documented.

Checklists for later phases are copied in from `DRUGWATCH_PHASES.md` §9 when each phase starts.

## Decision log

| 2026-11-03 | Gold layer confirmed = star schema + `mart_*` tables | ADR 0001 |
| 2026-11-03 | "Gold set" renamed to "labelled eval set" | Plan §9, §13, §24 |
| 2026-11-03 | Teaching mode added to `CLAUDE.md` §2 | CLAUDE.md |
| 2026-11-03 | RustFS replaces MinIO (MinIO community edition discontinued) | ADR 0002 |
| 2026-11-03 | Dev host ports: Postgres 5433, Redis 6380 (OpsPilot uses 5432 and 6379) | `docker-compose.yml` |
| 2026-11-03 | GitHub repo is public: HARITH935/drugwatch-india | — |
| 2026-11-03 | Language linters added when each language appears (Python: Phase 1, Java: 9, TS: 11); tool choice needs approval then | `lint.yml` |
| 2026-11-04 | Buckets created by a one-shot `rustfs-init` job (compose profile `setup`) using curl's SigV4 signing: no new tool | `docker-compose.yml` |
| 2026-11-04 | Local RustFS access key rotated after it was accidentally shown in terminal output; old key verified dead (403) | — |
| 2026-11-04 | CDSCO NSQ portal (cdscoonline.gov.in JSON, 2019 →) is the primary source; PDFs kept for 2017–2018 and Phase 2 | ADR 0004 |
| 2026-11-04 | Anonymous-visitor access rule; manual browser download where blocked (NPPA IPDMS); Pharma Sahi Daam not used | ADR 0003 |
| 2026-11-04 | CDSCO and Jan Aushadhi data not published until permission recorded; requests drafted | ADR 0003, `docs/permissions.md` |

| 2026-11-04 | Retries hand-written so every attempt passes the 3 s/host limiter (urllib3 `Retry` retries instantly once) | ADR 0005 (amended) |
| 2026-11-04 | raw/ layout: content-addressed `<prefix>/<sha256>.<ext>` + `.meta.json` sidecar written last ("done" marker) | `docs/data-sources.md` §6 |
| 2026-11-05 | Rate limit measured from the END of one request to the START of the next (slow responses can't shorten the gap). The limiter is per process: run each host's downloads in one process/Airflow task | `fetcher.py` |
| 2026-11-05 | CDSCO portal raw prefix `cdsco-portal/<nsq\|spurious>/<YYYY-MM>`; stored months skipped unless `--refresh` (recent months change as states report late) | `docs/data-sources.md` §6 |
| 2026-11-05 | CDSCO alerts HTML parsed with Python's built-in `html.parser` (one simple table), so no new library (BeautifulSoup would need approval) | `sources/cdsco_pdf.py` |
| 2026-11-05 | CDSCO PDF raw prefix includes CDSCO's file id (`cdsco-pdf/<kind>/<YYYY-MM>/<file id>`) so two documents for one month never collide; titles whose month doesn't fit the release date are skipped and reported, not stored | `docs/data-sources.md` §6 |
